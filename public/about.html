<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a creative person who enjoys learning new things and taking on new adventures. Over time, I have coordinated
  a women's English learning and community center, a high school robtics team, and a youth soccer league.
</p>

<p>Seeking to further my adventures, I began learning full-stack programming last year. Programming is challenging and rewarding.
  I am excited to start programming for others as I sharpen my skills.
</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Lubbock Christian University and currently work as an 
  adminstrative assistant at UT Arlington. I help to keep the Deans Office of the College of Business running smoothly.
  Before this I was a Commissions Analyst for APL, Inc. While at APL, I used proprietary software and Excel to process 
  structured commissions for agents at insurance companies. I built and amended detailed process manuals for each insurance
   company client, for disaster recovery planning purposes.
